# Bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like store that utilizes a database to store the inventory values and is run on the command line. 
Each item has: 
* unique item ID 
* item name 
* department 
* price
* stock level 
* total sales.

There are three different apps that all have different functionality.
* Bamazon Customer
* Bamazon Manager
* Bamazon Supervisor

## Bamazon Customer
This app allows the user to view the entire inventory and place an order. The app checks the inventory available to make sure it can fulfill the order and cancels the order if there is insufficient inventory. 

## Bamazon Manager
This app allows the user to view inventory, increase inventory, or add a new product.

## Bamazon Supersvisor
This app allows the user to create a new department and view department overhead cost and department sales.
